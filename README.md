# LatinSquare

Creates a Latin Square of size n: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square

I extrapolated the experimental results and for n = 100 it would take roughly 28 hours to compute such a latin square. For classical methods (non-tailor-suited methods) it would take more than 115 days to complete it.

Read the report for information how to use it.

The report also includes all the development process and performance evaluations.
